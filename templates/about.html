        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
		recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
		Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
		Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
		Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
		action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
		leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
                youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
                the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
                in death.

                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also
                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
                Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
                others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin.

                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
                referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
                brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
                Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
                Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
                2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
                Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

                younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
                accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left
                the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In
                TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood
                from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin
                to inform him the news.

                was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
                quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>
                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of
                Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time
                amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë,
                Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda, yet his ways often
                took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among
                them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser.
                Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of
                Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.
                <br>
                When the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to counsel and assist
                all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda included Olórin among the five to be sent.
                At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood,
                and told Olórin that such was a reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One
                Ring, containing much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manwë insisted that
                Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to send Olórin as the second instead. He
                agreed, and prepared for Olórin's departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about
                the same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.

                Arrival in Middle-earth
                <br>

                Gandalf is received by Círdan
                <br>

                Olórin, like the other Wizards, took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey and wandered about as
                a counsellor. At Mithlond he was welcomed by Glorfindel, his friend from Valinor (who had been sent
                earlier on a similar mission), and Círdan the shipwright who possessed Narya, one of the Three Elven
                Rings of Power. Círdan divined in Olórin a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent
                and aged man. Círdan gave Narya to Olórin with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a
                promise that it would support and aid him in his labours.
                <br>

                He then began his sojourn in Middle-earth and during many years, he walked among the elves as a
                stranger, learning from them and teaching them. Unlike Saruman, Olórin did not take up a single
                permanent residence and never went to the east, apparently restricting his activities to the
                Westlands of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the Dúnedain and the Eldar remained to oppose Sauron.
                He was known by many names during the long years he wandered: Elves named him Mithrandir, the "Grey
                Pilgrim", while the men of Arnor named him Gandalf, which became his most common name. He was also known
                as Incánus (in the south), and Tharkûn to the Dwarves. He later revealed himself as one of the
                Istari, and eventually became known as not only the wisest but also the most powerful individual in that
                order.
                <br>

                A legend says that Gandalf was given by Yavanna the Elfstone of Eärendil, to bring to the peoples of
                Middle-earth as a token that the Valar had not forsaken them. He gave it to Galadriel, bearer of one of
                the Three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, remarked prophetically that she would in turn pass it
                to an individual who would also be called Elessar.

                Gandalf finds Thráin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur
                <br>

                When King Thráin II, a Dwarf of the royal line of Durin, disappeared on journey to Erebor, Gandalf
                looked for him. At some point after TA 2845 he entered the abandoned city of Khazad-dûm during this
                search. After this proved to be in vain, the Wizard exited through the Doors of Durin; however this
                experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside. In TA 2850, his quest led
                him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy. He found Thráin in the dungeons, who gave the
                Wizard his last possessions, the map and key to Erebor. Most importantly, he found out that the
                Necromancer was not a Nazgûl – it was Sauron himself, and he had taken the last of the Seven Rings from
                the Dwarf King; Sauron was gathering the remaining Rings of Power and possibly searching for his lost
                One Ring.

                Quest of Erebor
                <br>
                Conception of a plan
                <br>
                Over the years, Gandalf became concerned about the weak state of the North. Smaug the dragon had
                destroyed both the Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale, and the wizard feared that Sauron
                might use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and the old lands
                of Angmar. Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf King of Durin's Folk, Thorin II Oakenshield, planned to battle
                against Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In TA 2941, while staying the night in Bree,
                Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King. Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange
                feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. The same was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well.
                They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through the Shire on his way to
                the Ered Luin), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to
                discuss the dragon Smaug with Thorin.
                <br>

                Ultimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune,
                albeit with a "burglar" of Gandalf's own choosing.
